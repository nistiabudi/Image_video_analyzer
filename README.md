Im using this code to generate metadata CSV for Adobe Contributor Image and Video also Freepik Image Contributor. 

How to use it
you just have to create virtual environment
then install the library using python install -r requirements.txt (p.s: usually when you install virtual environment there is option on there that put you to choose requirement.txt)
after that, go to src file then run main.py
